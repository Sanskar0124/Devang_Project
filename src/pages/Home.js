      content="Theres nothing more contagious in video games than sequelitis, but even then, The Last of Us felt like a masterpiece that should have been left alonw Naughty Dogs post-apocalyptic action-adventure was a crowning achievement at the end of the PS3s life cycle, not only reinvigorating tired zombie and post-apocalyptic settings but elevating video game storytelling to the same maturity as any other medium. But after everything Joel and Ellie had been through, surely there was nothing more to add that wouldnt diminish the power of its divisive and ambiguous ending."

      content="Sorry. Is that not a fancy enough intro? A little blunt? It’s just that the longer we’re sat here writing a review about Deathloop, the less time we’re spending actually playing it, and all we want to do right now is play it. Forever. Ad infinitum. You know… like the very premise of Deathloop itself. Anyone who’s spent time creeping across Dunwall’s roof tiles in Dishonored will likely already know that Arkane Studios – the same team behind Deathloop – are not your typical game designers. In fact, both Dishonored games are so bloody good, it was difficult to imagine how Deathloop could have improved on the teams delicious formula of meaty combat."

      content="Halo games have always given you the illusion of an expansive world just by nature of looking up at the sky to see the other side of an alien ring world but Halo Infinite takes that next logical step by giving you an open world with the new Zeta Halo. You might worry at first. After all, Halo’s always excelled with well-paced linear story missions – even if some of the most memorable missions do have a degree of openness to them, which surely would be spoiled by trying to be like Far Cry distracting you with a lot of icons and objectives."

      content="After Forza Horizon 4’s jolly jaunt around the grey roads and skies of the UK, this fifth iteration takes players somewhere just a touch warmer. The Horizon festival hits Mexico, a vibrant combination of winding beach roads, dense jungle and sun-bleached desert, all overlooked by a gargantuan active volcano – Forza Horizon’s highest ever summit. It’s an incredible place to set any open world game – and an absolute paradise for driving. The game handles the various automotive disciplines superbly. Obviously, road racing is long-established as a Forza forte, from the mainline track-focused series to every Horizon entry, but here we have a new focus on off-rooad."

      heading="Final Fantasy VII Remake" 
      content="The original game, first released in 1997, was responsible for awakening audiences to the emotional power of video game storytelling and effectively putting Japanese role-playing games on the global map. Even as the series continues into the double-digits, the universe of Final Fantasy VII resonates the most, having been revisited via a computer animated film sequel and spin-offs, while Buster Sword-wielding protagonist Cloud has made guest appearances in other beloved games like Kingdom Hearts and Super Smash Bros. But it’s the original source that everyone has been dying to see remade."

Expertly combining puzzling, platforming, action and nonlinear exploration in a sci-fi universe dripping with atmosphere, the adventures of bounty hunter Samus Aran are up there with anything the medium has to offer. While we continue to wait for a proper look at Metroid Prime 4, Nintendo shocked gamers tuned in to its 2021 E3 Direct presentation by announcing the first brand new 2D Metroid game in nearly 20 years. Originally intended as a Nintendo DS game but eventually cancelled, on years ago."

      content="Sadly, the game initially bombed when it first released in 2005 as an exclusive for the original Xbox, and could have easily been swept away with other platforming also-rans (remember Blinx: The Time Sweeper or Oddworld: Munch’s Oddysee, anyone?). But it had far more going for it thanks to its unusual art style that was less Pixar, more Laika, with a genuinely interesting story that wasn’t just about saving the princess, the world, or collecting a hundred MacGuffins. Its long overdue sequel – following a crowdfunding campaign before Microsoft decided to snap up developer Psychonauts 2 is also an important game that contributes to the more open discussions of mental health."

      content="It’s a weird one on paper. Unlike the usual tropes that posit we’ll be flying cars and living in biomes in the not-too-distant future, the Horizon franchise’s futuristic planet Earth is a world so decimated by technology, humankind has been forced to… well, reboot itself. There are no mobile phones here. No internet. No memes. No fast food, even (oh, the humanity). The world has been reset, and the only memory of its technologically-rich past lie in the ruins that scar the landscape and the hulking, animal-esque machines that roam the land."
